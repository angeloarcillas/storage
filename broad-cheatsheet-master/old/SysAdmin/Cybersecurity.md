## Top 10 Web Application Risks
1. **Injection**
  - Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
2. **Broken Authentication**
  - Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly.
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
  - Improper protection against sensitive data, such as Personal Identifiable Information, Financial and Healthcare.
4. **XML External Entities**
  - External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks
5. **Broken Access Control**
  - Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.
6. **Security Misconfiguration**
  - Insecure default configurations, incomplete configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
7. **Coss-site Scripting**
  - XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript.
8. **Insecure Deserialization**
  - Used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
  - Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules. Using components with known vulnerabilities may weaken application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
  - missing or ineffective integration with incident response.

**Preventions of OWASP Top 10**
1. injection
    - use prepared statement
    - sanitize inputs
    - use tokens
2. broken authentication
    - conduct testing
3. sensitive data exposure
    - hash/encrypt critical datas
4. xml external entities - XXE
    - disable inline parsing of DTDs
    - limit web service privileges 
5. broken access control
    - limit user previlages
6. security misconfiguration
    - remove comments
    - remove debugging
    - setup code for production
    - setup cpanel for security
7. cross-site scripting - XXS
    - sanitize inputs
8. insecure de-serialization
9. using components with known vulnerabilities
    - use updated components
    - remove known vulnerabilities
10. insufficient logging & monitoring
    - monitor website
