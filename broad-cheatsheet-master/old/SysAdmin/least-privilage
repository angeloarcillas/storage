The “principle of least privilege” states that every user or process within a a system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to undertake their job. This helps mitigate any risks if a component is compromised or an individual goes rogue.

Applying the principle to technology stacks means:

    Running web-server processes as non-root users, and restricting the directories they can access on disk, and what they can do there.

    Opening firewall ports only when necessary.

    Limiting access to databases, and requiring processes that connect to databases to run under named accounts with limited permissions.

    Provisioning services only when necessary, rather than making them accessible in an ad-hoc manner.

The principle can be applied to personnel too. You should:

    Restrict access to production systems – ensure that access is only available under named accounts and for limited windows of time.

    Have clearly defined roles and release processes, so access can be restricted in a meaningful way.

    Ensure that data used in test systems is scrubbed of any sensitive information.

    Ensure that credentials for your key systems are known only by those who require it for their job function, and that these credentials are rotated frequently
