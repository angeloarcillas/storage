rules of a forensic investigation
-limit access to original evidence
-make duplicate copies and examine those
-record changes
-chain of custody
-standards
-know limitations of skills
-secure storage
-legal
-industry tools

type of evidence - volatile evidence
-system time
-process information
-open files
-network information
-process memory
-clipboard
-service/driver information
-command history

type of evidence - none volatile evidence
-slack-space
-hidden files
-swap file
-unallocated clusters
-unused partitions
-registry settings
-event logs

best evidence rule
-prevent alteration of digital evidence
	-duplicate admissible if:
		-originaal evidence destroyed in fire/flood
		- " in the normal course of business
		- " in possession of third party

forensic readiness
-optimal use of digital evidence,in limited time, with limited investigation costs

incident response
-using forensics to examine malware,data breaches,etc..

forensic investigator
-evaluates damage
-identifies/recovers data
-extracts evidence in sound manner
-proper handling
-creates reports
-testifies
-stay current

ethics
-fairness
-integrity
-conflict of interest

pre-investigation phase
-planning/budget
-lab setup/design
-data destruction
-evidence locker
-workstations
-certifications
-Quality assurance
-Auditing
-Laws

investigation phase
-consent/warrant
-first responder
-photograph/document scene
-collect evidence
-analyze evident
	warrants
		-electronic storage device
		-services provider
	warrants not needed
		-person with authority consents
		-like child pornography/destruction of evidence

post-investigation phase
-social media behavior
-collecting social media evidence
-tools:facebook,forensic software,netlytic,social discovery,navigator,etc..

best practices
-authorization from decision maker
-first response
-search and seize
-evidence collection
-secure
-copy
-acquire/analyze
-report
-testify

powered off computer
-if its off,leave it off
-photograph
-monitor on:move mouse slightly

network computer
-photograph/document
-unplug network cable from router/modem
-collect all cords and peripherals connected
-document

chain of custody
-legal document
-demonstrates progression of evidence
-should list all people involved in evidence collection/preservation,their actions, and contain a time stamp

exhibiting numbering
-name of investigator seizing -> alpabetical
-date of the seizure -> dd/mm/yy
-sequential number of exhibits -> start with 001
-sequence number for parts of the same exhibit -> 0101a/001b

data recovery tools
-recuva
-advanced disk recovery
-undeleteplus
-the sleuth kit(TSK) & autopsy
-enCase
-FTK

HDD
-uses magnetic storage to store/retreive data
-non-volatile storage
-platters
  -circular metal disk mounted into drive enclosure
  -2 heads per platter
-tracks
  -concentric rings on platter
-sectors
  -smallest physical storage on hard disk platter
		bad sectors
			-portions of disk unusable due to flaws
			-configuration issues
			-physical disturbance to disk
		master boot record(MBR)
			-starts at sector 0
			-0xAA55
-clusters
	-smallest accessible logical storage unit
	-formed by combining sectors together
	slack space
		-wasted area of disk cluster

BIOS parameter block (BPB)
	-describes physical layout of storage volume
	-volume boot record
	-FAT16,FAT32,NTSF
	-nibble 4bits byte 8bits

UEFI boot process phases
	-security phase(SEC)
		-handles platform restart event
	-pre-EFI initialization(PEI)
		-passing control to the DXE
	-driver execution environment(DXE)
		-DXE dispatcher -discover/execute DXE drivers in correct order
	-boot device selection(BDS)
		-load/execute boot selection
	-runTime(RT)
		-enables os to read/write enviroment variables
		-clears UEFI from memory

windows
-traditional BIOS
-UEFI BIOS

Windows -boot process
1.cpu send signal to motherboard,checks the bios firmware
2.bios start a post (power on self test) and firmware settings from non-volatile memory loaded
3.post-success/add-on adapters perform self test
4.valid boot system disk detected
5.firmware scans boot disk and load MBR
6.MBR triggers bootmgr.exe that locates windows loader
7.OS kernel(ntoskrnl.exe) loaded
8.Hal.dll and system registry hive loaded into memory
9.session manager:winlog.exe,service control manager,user session created

MAC -boot process
1.bootroom activated:initialize hardware
2.post for interface
3.remaining hardware initialize,EFI for intel-based and open firmware for powerPC-based
4.OS selected
5.control passed to bootX or boot.efi boot loaders
6.kernel loaded
7.launch runs and startup item and prepare system

LINUX bios stage -boot process
1.system hardware initialized
2.bios retrieves informationstored in CMOS and POST test done
3.BIOS serches for OS

linux bootloader stage -boot process
1.loads the kernel (bootleaders:LILO and GRUB)
2.virtual file system named initrd(init RAMdisk)
3.actual root file system prepare for deployment
4.detection of device containsthe filesystem
5.kernel loaded into memory

linux kernel stage -boot process
1.virtual root filesystem(VFS)executers linuxrc program
2.kernl search for new hardware and loads driver
3.root filesystem mounted
4.rest of system loaded and user logs in
