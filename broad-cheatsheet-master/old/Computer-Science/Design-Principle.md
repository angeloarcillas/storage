# Design Principles


<details>
<summary>S.O.L.I.D.</summary>

**Single Responsiblity Principle**
  - classes should have only one responsiblity

**Open/closed Principle**
  - classes should be open for extension and closed for modification

**Liskov Substitution Principle**
  - Child class should not modify Parent/Base class methods

**Interface Segregation Principle**
  - Classes that implement interfaces, should not be forced to implement methods they do not use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**
  - High level modules should not depend on low level modules rather both should depend on abstraction.
  - Abstraction should not depend on details; rather detail should depend on abstraction
